# Housing Price Prediction

Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features and attributes of the houses. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can estimate the prices of houses and gain insights into the factors that influence their values.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset that contains information about houses, including features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the predictive models.

## Methodology

1. Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand its structure, feature distribution, missing values, and correlations between variables. This step helps us gain insights into the data and identify patterns.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, remove outliers, and transform categorical variables into numerical representations. Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is suitable for training machine learning models.

3. Feature Engineering: Additional features are created based on domain knowledge and insights from the dataset. Feature engineering enhances the predictive power of the models by capturing important information that may not be explicitly present in the original dataset.

4. Model Selection: Various regression models are considered, such as linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. The models are evaluated based on their performance and ability to accurately predict housing prices.

5. Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The selected models are trained using the training data, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (housing prices).

6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. These metrics help assess the performance and accuracy of the models in predicting housing prices.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/alzx1/Housing-Price-Prediction.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook


4. Open the `Housing price prediction.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions.

## Results

The project provides accurate predictions of housing prices based on the selected regression models. The model with the best performance can be used to estimate housing prices for new, unseen data.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional features that may impact housing prices, such as proximity to amenities, crime rates, and school quality.
- Explore advanced regression techniques, such as ensemble methods or neural networks, to further improve the prediction accuracy.
- Develop a web-based application or API for convenient and user-friendly access to the housing price prediction functionality.
